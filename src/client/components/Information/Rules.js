            <b>1. </b>
            In an auction sale, there can be many goods up for sale of many kinds. If some particular goods are put up for sale in a lot, then each such lot will be considered a separate subject of a separate contract of sale. So each lot ill prima facie be the subject of its own contract of sale.</p>
          <p>
            <b>2. </b>
            The sale is complete when the auctioneer says it is complete. This can be done by actions also â€“ like the falling of the hammer, or any such customary action. Till the auctioneer does not announce the completion of the sale the prospective buyers can keep bidding.</p>
          <p>
            <b>3. </b>
            The seller may reserve his right to bid. To do so he must expressly reserve such right to bid. In this case, the seller on any person on his behalf can bid at the auction.</p>
          <p>
            <b>4. </b>
            An auction sale may be subject to a reserve price or an upset price. This means the auctioneer will not sell the goods for any price below the said reserve price.</p>
          <p>
            <b>5. </b>

            Items should be in good shape and available to use without any defects. The quality of the items should be maintained. </p>
